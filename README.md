The district summary was affected when adjusting Thomas High School Grade 9 scores. Some of the 9th grader from Thmoas High School math and reading scores were replaced by NaN. Replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance due to no value. AS a result, their overall percentage and Thomas High School is now no longer one of the top 5 schools.

## Summary: 
Removing the 9th grader at Thomas High School and replacing it with Nan caused the school's overall passing percentage and average scores to decrease. Because of this decrease, it appears that the student population is failing both math and reading. The school dropped from being in the top 5 schools due to this. This also affected the district, causing them to also decrease slight in their overall scores.
